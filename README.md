Develop a scheduling system to allow patients to schedule hospital appointments through a `graphical interface (GUI)` made using the Tkinter library in Python. This project aims to streamline the scheduling process, facilitating patients' access to medical services.

## Functionalities
### 1. Graphical interface:
Design an intuitive and attractive GUI using Tkinter, ensuring patients can easily interact with the system.

### 2. Doctor Profiles:
Create profiles for each doctor, displaying information such as name, specialty, availability and contact details.

### 3. Scheduling:
Implement a system that allows patients to schedule consultations by selecting their preferred date and time slot from the available options.

### 4. Pacient Registration:
Include a patient registration system where patients can create accounts, providing details such as name, contact information and any medical history.

### 5. Confirmation:
Send confirmations to both patients and doctors once the appointment has been successfully made, including details such as date, time and location.

### 6. Reminders:
Integrate a notification system to remind patients about upcoming appointments, reducing the risk of unannounced absences.

### 7. Cancel And Reschedule:
Allow patients to cancel or reschedule appointments within a specific time frame, updating the schedule for both patients and doctors.
